# Discord Hack Week Event Reminder Bot
Simple bot for Discord Hack Week that will remind users of an event. Useful for gathering people together, such as for a game night!

Set up and tested on Ubuntu 16.04.
It should work on other Ubuntu versions, similar linux distros or anywhere node runs at this point.

The bot requires setting up a MySQL database and it be running. If you don't know how to, there are plenty of guides around :)

1. Install Nodejs and setup database
 - I followed a guide and installed version 8.12.0, and npm 6.4.1
    ```
    cd ~
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
    ```
  - Then confirm versions of node and npm with `node -v` and `npm -v`. 

  2. Clone the Repository
  
  3. `npm install`
  
  4. Get your bot token from your application on https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ and add it into token.js
  
  5. Rename the \_config.json file to config.json and edit the database information to match your settings
  
  6. Run `sequelize db:migrate` or `node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate` to setup the tables.
  
  6. Run bot with `node start.js`

## Commands

**Creating an Event**

To create an event, you must have a role named `eventbotplanner` or have the `Administrator` permission.

`.CreateEvent "[event title]" [days]-[hours]-[minutes]`

Example command for a WoW Raid that is happening in 2 hours and 20 minutes from now:

`.CreateEvent "Wow Raid" 0-2-20`

**Deleting an Event**

To delete an event, you must be the event creator or have the `Administrator` permission. The event message should have the command in it, but just incase, you can perform this:

`.DeleteEvent [eventMessageID]`

**Signing Up For Event**

To sign-up for the event, all you need to to is react to the "âœ…" emoji. This will assign you an event role that is used for notifying. To cancel the sign-up, just unreact with the message. All other reactions with emojis will not change your sign-up status

**Removing Old Roles**

This bot creates a role for each event. Once the event is over and the roles are no longer needed a user with `Administrator` permission can run this to remove them:

`.RemoveInactiveRoles`
